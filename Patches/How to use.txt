how to use and patch info

Place the patches in your Data folder to see everything in action, if you wanna join, just tell us and make a patch based off your name letter

the patches atm are

Patch-A	:	Interface and database files
Patch-B	:	Bustas patch
Patch-C	:	canas patch
Patch-G	:	gios patch
Patch-M	:	murlocs patch
Patch-S	:	Game model sounds and texture files	(the s is for shrek)

dont put anything in patch a and s but keep to your respective patches pls
for cleanliness sake, put your models and relevant textures in ShrekModels\yourname\whateverthefuckyouwant in your relevant patch.
if doing other funky shit, know what the directory your putting in is and what your replacing

the MPQ structure is just everything i have compiled upto 2.16.19, its essentially the patches but im a folder directory so you can all see the layout

would reccomend starting an organisation system for this, or a seperate folder for just user generated content instead of replacement files

Server stuff is a lot but is just for Helio to compile
